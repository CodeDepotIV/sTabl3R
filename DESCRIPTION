Description: Quickly generate general statistics and summary tables for
    demographic/phenotypic/clinical variables using a formatted data frame
    and a specified grouping variable. This project was motivated by a
    perceived need to accelerate data table production using some reasonable
    (albeit general) assumptions about the provided data. In its current form, it
    consists of a set of two major R functions to (1) perform statistical
    analysis on a given data frame using a pre-specified grouping variable;
    and (2) generate tables using a combination of `knitr` and
    `flextable`. Developed using R version 4.4.0.
